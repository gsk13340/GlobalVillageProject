      <p> <strong> <h3> We are a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization accredited as a special purpose middle school, serving refugee students from Clarkston, Georgia - one of the most diverse cities in the nation. Our innovative program was first imagined in 2009, in response to the fact that many teenage refugee girls need more intensive and individualized support than their siblings. These young women are placed in middle and high schools when they are resettled, even though many of them arrive in the U.S. with Pre-K to 2nd grade skills in math and reading. In order to succeed academically and socially in their new home, refugee young women need a space designed specifically for their needs as older newcomers. </p> </strong> </h3>

          <p> <b> <h3> Personal Experience: </b> </h3> <h4> I spent 6 months working with GVP during an internship with them. It was an all girls school, with a 40 person capacity. They created a safe environment for the students to express themselves, and feel comfortable playing around with their own ideas and language. Many girls were around the age of 14, and of course they had an attitude of a 14 year old. I believe that most of these girls would not be getting the attention they would need in other schools, so The Global Village Project is a necessary institution. They give the individual attention that these girls need because their experiences and needs can be easily misunderstood. Some of the students had anger issues because the ability to process the events these girls have gone through is a feat. A refugee has to stay in a refugee camp for a year before the USA will allow them to seek asluym in our country, but the average stay for a person in a camp is 10 years. These students need particular attention to help cope with their emotional needs while they adjust to their new life in the US. It was a life changing experience. To watch these bright young girls, who have gone through trauma that most people can't even imagine, and then to watch them grow, learn, and develope is an indescribable experience. I will always support Global Village Project. </h4> </p>
